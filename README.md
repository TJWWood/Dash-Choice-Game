If you download this project to open in Unity: please create a custom aspect ratio for use in the editor of 1440 * 2560 or 1080 * 1920 - this will allow you to test the game as it was designed.

The game is played as followed - Click either the left or right side of the screen to choose a side to play for the round then click anywhere to fire the ball.

This game is a WIP and will include extra features when complete such as a tutorial stage, and colour and ball customisation (through a store).
